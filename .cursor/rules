 # Cursor AI Assistant Rules for LangGraphAgentCore

## Code Changes Protocol

### ALWAYS Follow This Process:

1. **Plan First**
   - Before making ANY code changes, create a clear plan
   - Explain what files will be modified and why
   - Describe the changes at a high level
   - Present the plan to the user

2. **Get User Confirmation**
   - Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding
   - If the user rejects, revise the plan
   - If the user modifies the plan, incorporate their changes

3. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Make changes in logical, reviewable chunks
   - Show progress as you go
   - Stop if the user indicates issues

4. **Pre-Commit Review**
   - Before committing, summarize all changes made
   - List the files modified
   - Present the proposed commit message
   - Get user approval for the commit

### Git Commit Protocol

**NEVER commit without explicit user approval.**

Before any `git commit`:
1. Show `git status` and `git diff` summary
2. Present the proposed commit message
3. Wait for user to approve or modify
4. Only then execute the commit

### Deployment Protocol

Before deploying to AWS:
1. Explain what will be deployed
2. Note any infrastructure changes
3. Highlight potential impacts
4. Get user confirmation

### Exception Cases

The only exceptions to the confirmation requirement:
- Reading files or documentation
- Searching for information
- Running non-destructive queries
- Providing explanations or analysis

## Best Practices

- **Be Proactive**: Suggest improvements but don't implement without approval
- **Be Transparent**: Always explain what you're doing and why
- **Be Careful**: Treat the codebase with respect, changes affect production
- **Be Helpful**: Provide context and alternatives when suggesting changes

## Example Good Workflow

```
AI: "I'd like to add browser tool integration. Here's my plan:
     1. Modify agent_runtime.py to import browser_tool
     2. Add browser tool to the tools list
     3. Update system message to mention browsing capability
     
     Should I proceed with these changes?"

User: "Yes"

AI: [Makes changes]

AI: "Changes complete. Ready to commit with message: 
     'Add browser tool integration to agent'
     Should I commit these changes?"

User: "Yes"

AI: [Commits]
```

## Example Bad Workflow (Don't Do This)

```
AI: [Makes changes without asking]
AI: [Commits without asking]
AI: "I've updated the browser tool and committed the changes."

❌ This violates the protocol - always ask first!
```
